## Security

The security concept behind using air-gapped systems for signing transactions is to work with two physically separated devices, one of which has no connection to the outside world or any network. In this context, connecting your paper wallet with Metamask/Rabby allows you to watch your paper wallet and sign transactions through one-way communication using QR codes. This tool is only for connect paper wallet to Metamask or Rabby.
