#### Security Tip: Use this application only on a permanently air-gapped machine for maximum security.
#### Warning: Never type your cold wallet or hardware wallet seed phrase on a device that connects to the internet.

## Description

- TBC

## Features

- Completely offline
- Completely air-gapped, no wired/wiresless connections required
- Create new ethereum wallets
- Optional passphrase support
- Generate seed phrase through dice roll & coin flip
- Find the last word (checksum) for a manually generated seed phrase 
- Supports custom derivation paths (m/44'/60'/n'/)
- Encrypt and export wallet as a keystore file (UTC/JSON)
- Connect any wallet to Metamask or Rabby as a hardware wallet
- Sign transactions using QR codes.
- Virutal keyboard

### Create a new wallet

Choose from 12/15/18/21/24 words for the mnemonic seed phrase. Optionally use a passphrase and a custom derivation path.

A seed phrase is generated by creating cryptographically secure entropy using ethers.randomBytes(bytes) and converting that entropy into a BIP-39 mnemonic seed phrase. This ensures the resulting seed phrase has sufficient randomness for secure key generation.

## Security

The security concept behind using air-gapped systems for signing transactions is to work with two physically separated devices, one of which has no connection to the outside world or any network. In this context, connecting your wallet with Metamask/Rabby allows you to watch your wallet and sign transactions through one-way communication using QR codes.
